## UEA CMP Challenge 2020 
### Challenge task: Reaching isolated people

The app is a delivery app which allows charities and food banks to sign up to outsource deliveries for
isolated or rural people who have difficulty collecting the crucial supplies during the current crisis.
The app allows members of the public who could spare their time to help, sign up and perform needed deliveries
which are convenient for them and the charities. The app works by finding deliveries which are nearby a  journey 
the driver is about to take for example driving back home from work. [More here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19f5Dp3D1yzbbZhs9ibedBOp5O-marDjdcsIVuFaF5wY/edit?usp=sharing)
