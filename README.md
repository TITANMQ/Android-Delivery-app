## UEA CMP Challenge 2020 
### Challenge task: Reaching isolated people

This prototype app is a delivery app which allows charities and food banks to sign up to outsource deliveries for vulnerable people who are isolated or based in rural areas during the current crisis. The app allows members of the public to volunteer their time and sign up to perform needed deliveries which are convenient for them and the charities.  The app works by finding deliveries which are nearby a  journey the driver is about to take for example driving back home from work.
